# CobolSong
Do not use this code for anything real - it was an interesting contrarian diversion only.

It makes a call to OpenAI GPT-4 to generate a video challenge for a hard coded month.
It then draws a console based render of the calendar.

It depends on curl, jq and remind commands being installed.

It was written on a Mac, but anything with gnu-cobol and the above commands should work.
